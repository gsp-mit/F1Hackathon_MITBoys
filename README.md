# Hackmakers F1 hackathon Challenge 3 - 3D modelling

## Intro
Metaverse is booming and it is about to create a whole new interaction paradigm. Since Metaverse is relying on 3d assets that usually take a bit of time to model manually, we believe that using data to programmatically create 3d assets will benefit whole industry going forward. Using AI to programmatically create 3d asset is not a new concept and there are many Research & Development papers applying AI for various use cases spanning across animations, shaders, sculpting or converting 2d images to 3d assets.

## Our Solution
We present to you an incredible glimpse of some of the race tracks that we have been so used to watching on television but now with a whole new enriching perspective from the fans point of view.

We have set out to programmatically create a 3D-Model of an F1 track that would be scalable to most tracks currently on the F1 Calendar. A ready to use Blender Python script to render a 3D Model utilizing geometric coordinates of track data (like x-y-z coordinates & optimum race line).
